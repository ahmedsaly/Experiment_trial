I am doing an online experiment through a website. And i want your help to make a data structure of the data i want to collect. so it's easier later when i do the analysis. so the experiment is that i show people panorama pic that represent a viewpoint inside a layout of floor building. the user is able to browse through the panorama scene using mouse or arrows. and he can choose the correct layout that the panorama view is representing. And there is lot of views he can browse between (by hitting next for example, he is able to see another panorama view from the same layout). And as the experiment is paid, I am giving money based on good performance (highest amount earned when the correct layout is selected with the least needed views to be seen) therefore with each next view, the possible earned money is getting less and if at the end he chose the correct layout choice, he will earn what is left of this possible money. but if it's incorrect, nothing would be earned. After submitting the choice, the user goes to the next layout and tested with the same. Note: before submitting the layout choice, I ask people on how confident they are for their answer.

As for the data i want to collect. I want to know for each layout: layout name/code, how many views have been seen, duration of each view, the selected answer, correct answer or not, the bonus money earned, Confidence level

and for each view, I want somehow to record everything to be able to redo exactly what the user did. for example, I want to know what the user was doing and how much time did it take him. (as a note, the website has the panorama in a full screen and there is hidden area in the bottom appears when the user hover to the bottom, this bottom section has the layout choices where the user can select one of them and can click submit button, then the confidence message appear to select confidence level then hit cofirm submition then next layout button appears. Also I have divided my panorama scene into 4 sections in my script (each section is 90 degree view)) so i want to record for example for each view the timeline of the user actions; for example spent 2 sec on section 1, then 4 seconds on section 2, then back to section 1 and spent 4 seconds, then he hovers down and now he is in bottom section and so i want for bottom section (the time spent in this section and if anything is clicked(layout choice, confidence level, any button), i want to record).

I have the script and will be able to get these data. but i want your help now to make the main first data structure to store these data in a nice way so i can read them easily and i can use them later in my analysis. I am saving the data in csv already, so if you provide me with csv scheme.
